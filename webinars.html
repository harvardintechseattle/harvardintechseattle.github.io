                                    China is in the forefront of digital currency Renminbi (RMB) electronic payment
                                    at world level. Their goal is to maintain control of money supply & prevent foreign
                                    exchange risks. This official adoption of cryptocurrency in China is with the aim to
                                    gradually reduce the dependency of the US dollar.

                                    The decision to move the U.S to digital currency five to seven years from now is

                                    The free and non-fungible nature of bitcoin’s energy consumption makes it greener

                            <ol>
                                <li>There are a plethora of emerging technologies with NatSec implications and DOD has
                                    made great strides in building cross sector partnerships, up-skilling, and
                                    forecasting, to help it take advantage of several tech revolutions, including
                                    digital, bio and quantum. Still more needs to be done to allow emerging tech to be
                                    integrated and adopted at a DOD scale and with older hardware while developing norms
                                    and humanitarian law to ensure new tech is deployed responsibility.</li>
                                <li>Quantum Computing is a long horizon platform that will vastly reshape war and peace,
                                    from Quantum security, to Quantum Clocks, and Quantum Communications to synchronize
                                    All Domain Warfare. These same technologies have the potential to transform
                                    economies, supply chains, and data security, and privacy for corporations and
                                    individuals.</li>
                                <li> The tradeoff between security, role based access, and ease of use in Military
                                    Technology on the battlefield needs to evolve to match the civilian experience.
                                <li>Military and University partnerships need to be broader to include social sciences
                                    to address global culture to go beyond winning wars, and win the Peace. Universities
                                    need to offer, and Military roles and leadership needs to embrace PhD and advanced
                                    Graduate programs for Military personnel as part of a core leadership progression.
                                </li>
                                <li>Culture matters and needs to be considered on the front end of Military Action. Once
                                    we win the war, we need to win the peace. The seamless transition to a PeaceTime
                                    governance happens best when there is a comprehensive understanding of the end goal,
                                    and the means to achieve this goal through leadership in the countries where the war
                                    takes place. Like South Korea, Germany, and Japan, part of achieving a successful
                                    peace and thriving economic partnerships may involve long term military base
                                    installations to safeguard alliance countries and regions.</li>
                                <li>The world population growth from 7B to 10B will strain Global security, putting
                                    pressure on Food, Water, and Energy. The overlap between national security, and
                                    civilian economic activity will be expansive and requires holistic thinking and
                                    planning. DOD efforts need to seamlessly implement strategies and technologies to
                                    eliminate threats, increase sustainability of DOD activities, and to support
                                    compatible leadership regimes that resonate with the authentic cultures of the
                                    diverse regions of the world.</li>

                                    Technology, and more specifically social media platforms, and algorithms influence
                                    citizens. This can be positive, or negative depending on the platform policies, and
                                    the
                                    actors on the platform.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Technology policy alone cannot be expected to effectively secure free and fair
                                    elections. The U.S. government for example must set its public policy, laws, and
                                    regulations to drive incentives, including cyber tech to ensure proper engagement of
                                    Campaign support from foreign powers and interests.

                                    Policies that Social Media firms, and search engine firms set represent the
                                    interests of the firm's stakeholders. There is an overlap between the Firm's
                                    Stakeholders and Country's stakeholders, however the emphasis differs, and on a
                                    Global
                                    level foreign powers can take advantage of the differences between incentives that a
                                    firm has and the rights of citizens and interests of the nation to achieve their own
                                    foreign policy agenda.
                                </li>

                                    Social Media platforms offer a potential power equalizer with traditional lobbyists
                                    and special interest groups in that these platforms allow voters to combine their
                                    numbers to vote for candidates who represent the changes they seek. This can be seen
                                    both in the presidential election of Barack Obama, the election of the Squad, and
                                    the
                                    Black Lives Matter Movement. Globally it can be seen through the Arab Spring
                                    toppling
                                    the government by organizing and coordinating demands for change in an overwhelming
                                    fashion.

                                    Civic Tech, and the role that government plays can be updated and modernized to
                                    match government services to citizens needs through software, and platforms that
                                    leverage algorithms, machine learning, and AI. The government's role reimagined as a
                                    technology provider or purchaser of technology systems in the Civic domain can
                                    transform the quality of services that citizens receive. It also may reduce
                                    conflicts of
                                    interests between Firm interests i.e. special interest groups, and the rights and
                                    interests of
                                    the country. A good example of this is the Public Library system, or Military
                                    Hospitals.
                                    Defining the right level of capability and role for the public vs. private sector is
                                    a balance between efficiency, and price vs. national security. There is a lot of
                                    room
                                    for improvement, and a lot of potential for powerful change.

                            <ol>
                                <li>Smart City can improve the quality of life 10% - 30%</li>
                                <li>The most effective way to get the public to buy in to implement a Smart City is to
                                    find a specific pain point, and integrate a Smart City approach to show the value of
                                    Data Driven real time Intelligence integrated into city life. This will increase
                                    adoption of future Smart City projects, and overall appreciation for the importance
                                    of a Smart City.</li>
                                <li>Designing a Smart City should not be a Technology looking for a problem to solve, it
                                    should start with the needs of the City’s citizens.</li>
                                <li>Smart City alone cannot transform our economy. Economic Transformation requires that
                                    Smart City gains diffuse across all communities and current barriers due to race,
                                    and economic wealth hinders the diffusion of benefits.</li>
                                <li>Smart Cities adoption is increased if the City passes a law requiring Smart City
                                    compliance.</li>
                                <li>Data Security is much stronger if the Data Stores are distributed rather than
                                    Centralized.</li>

                            <ol>
                                <li>With technology, we have a choice. We can use technology to make the system fair,
                                    enrich society, unite the world and share the benefits that the world and technology
                                    has to offer in a loving and humanizing way</li>
                                <li>By 2042, the majority of the US population will be people of color. By closing the
                                    racial wealth gap, the US GDP could be projected 4% to 6% higher by 2028. No action
                                    will cost the US economy $1 to $1.5 trillion between 2019 and 2028. It is high time
                                    we reduce Systemic Racism on a targeted timeline and establish accountability at all
                                    levels of the society that triggers Systemic Racism. It is time to work together.
                                </li>
                                <li>Need to reform the Criminal Justice System to minimize racial bias. i.e. A
                                    centralized, nationwide Data System for Criminal Justice system (including Police
                                    personnel record), policy reform - reevaluate qualified immunity for police, the
                                    ability of employers, landlords, and others to disqualify people for misdemeanors
                                    and other minor crimes etc.</li>
                                <li>Fair representation in politics is needed so that the policymakers can make
                                    justified policy reform. Technology can be leveraged to have a grass root level
                                    initiative to make the change. </li>
                                <li>In order to leverage a high tech education system, initial funding is required to
                                    ensure basic needs are addressed . I.e. Laptop for all students, high speed Internet
                                    access for underprivileged communities.</li>
                                <li>Soft skill (scientifically measured personality and cognitive aptitude) based
                                    technology driven hiring process is unbiased.</li>

                                <li>“Operation Warp Speed” an US based program funding 5 Vaccine producers - Moderna,
                                    AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Merck to expedite the production of
                                    Vaccines. The program is committed to deliver a vaccine by Jan 2021 and they are on
                                    target.</li>
                                <li>The Gates Foundation has funded 7 Factories of leading COVID 19 Vaccine providers.
                                    This funding allows the exploration of vaccines along parallel paths, and avoids a
                                    bottleneck on the critical path of vaccine availability.</li>
                                <li>More than one Vaccine is necessary in order to allow distribution to reach Global
                                    Scale (15 billion). Innovation in transportation is necessary for some types of
                                    vaccines, such as mRNA to maintain stability. i.e OpenVaccine project.</li>
                                <li>The vaccines must be provided to high risk groups and communities, independent of

                                The unprecedented outbreak of COVID-19 across the globe has resulted in increased demand
                                for telemedicine solutions. Social distancing and lockdown implementation by several
                                countries as a preventive measure to curb the pandemic. The impact of COVID 19 led us to
                                explore with six distinguished panelists - Is Telemedicine is the future of Healthcare?

                            <ol>
                                <li>Telemedicine Technology combines hardware diagnostics, software platforms, and
                                    Medical Practice guidance & services. The menu of services possible is expansive,
                                    and COVID 19 demonstrates the need to expedite availability.</li>
                                <li>Telemedicine has global reach that can restructure the supply and demand for
                                    healthcare.</li>
                                <li>The Rural Urban Divide, and the low income vs. high income divide can be addressed
                                    through hybrid offerings via extended reach in the USA and overseas. Regulation and
                                    policy across states, and across borders needs to be streamlined and optimized for
                                    shared value.</li>
                                <li>Telemedicine can provide a cost effective alternative to cover many existing gaps in
                                    the current medical system. These include follow up medical treatment,
                                    clarification, diagnostics, and maintenance of care e.g. remedial exercises, and
                                    medication adherence.</li>
                                <li>Telemedicine is powerful, and the privacy, governance, and innovation mindset are
                                    important to establish Social acceptance.</li>
                                <li>Telemedicine is the future of medicine, and it is critical that all stakeholders are
                                    at the table to make sure it is the right future.</li>
